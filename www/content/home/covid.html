      <p>Supply lines are getting back to normal! Instead of a four week delay on fabrics, Mill Hill items, and threads, we are down to 10-14 days! Woohoo!</p>
            
      <p>If you need your items within a certain time frame, please email me for an estimated shipping time before placing your order.</p>
        
      <p>Working together and getting vaccinated, we can get through this even faster!</p>
