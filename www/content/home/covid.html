      <p>I am experiencing some supply line delays as many manufacturers, distributors, and designers are not up to full production/staffing levels. Wichelt Imports (fabrics, Mill Hill items, DMC floss and Pearl Cotton, etc) is shipping to me in about 4 weeks. Picture This Plus is shipping directly to you in 12+ weeks. Recently many delivery services, such as the US post office, UPS, and FedEx, are experiencing delays as well.</p>
        
      <p>Shipping can be delayed anywhere from a few days to several weeks.</p>
            
      <p>I am a one woman team right now, working 12 hour days, 6 days a week. I am doing my best to fill orders as soon as possible. Orders will be shipped in the order they are received. Your patience is greatly appreciated during this trying time.</p>
        
      <p>If you need your items within a certain time frame, please email me for an estimated shipping time before placing your order.</p>
        
      <p>Working together, we can get through this pandemic!</p>
      
      <p>Stay safe and stitch on!</p>
