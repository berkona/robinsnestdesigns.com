      <p>We are experiencing some supply line delays as many manufacturers, distributors, and designers are not up to full production/staffing levels.</p>
        
      <p>We are doing our best to fill orders as soon as possible, but please note that circumstances may continue to delay shipping anywhere from a few days to several weeks.</p>
        
      <p>We have also added extra cleaning and quarantining methods to keep your order's contents safe for you. This adds a few more days before we ship your order.</p>
        
      <p>Orders will be shipped as soon as they can, in the order they are received. Your patience is greatly appreciated during this trying time.</p>
        
      <p>If you need your items within a certain time frame, please email us for an estimated shipping time before placing your order.</p>
        
      <p>Working together, we can get through this pandemic!</p>
