      <p>I am experiencing some supply line delays as many manufacturers, distributors, and designers are not up to full production/staffing levels. Wichelt Imports (fabrics, Mill Hill kits/beads, DMC floss and Pearl Cotton, Kreinik, etc) is shipping to me in about 3 weeks (where 1 weeks is normal).</p>
        
      <p>Since I need to order many items as needed, shipping to you can be delayed anywhere from a few days to 3-4 weeks. Your patience is greatly appreciated during this trying time.</p>
            
      <p>If you need your items within a certain time frame, please email me for an estimated shipping time before placing your order.</p>
        
      <p>Working together, we can get through this!</p>
      
      <p>Stay safe and stitch on!</p>
