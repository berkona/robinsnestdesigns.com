      <p>I am experiencing some supply line and shipping delays. Since I may need to order items for your order, shipping to you can be delayed anywhere from a few days to 3-4 weeks. Your patience is greatly appreciated during this trying time.</p>
            
      <p>If you need your items within a certain time frame, please email me for an estimated shipping time before placing your order.</p>
        
      <p>Working together, we can get through this!</p>
      
      <p>Stay safe and stitch on!</p>
